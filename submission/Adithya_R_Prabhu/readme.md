## OZP cipher
This Python code is for encrypting and decrypting text using the OZP cipher algorithm. The code takes user input for encryption or decryption, text to encrypt/decrypt, and a key. The `encrypt_text()` function takes a string and an integer as input and returns the encrypted text as a string. The `decrypt_text()` function takes an encrypted text and an integer as input and returns the decrypted text as a string. The `add_num()` function takes a string and an integer as input and returns a string. The code also imports two modules, ozp_cipher_decoder and ozp_cipher_encoder, which contain the `decrypt_text()` and `encrypt_text()` functions respectively. The code then prompts the user to enter whether they want to encrypt or decrypt, the text to encrypt/decrypt, and a key. The encrypted/decrypted text is then returned as output
